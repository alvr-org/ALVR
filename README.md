# ALVR - Air Light VR

[![badge-discord][]][link-discord] [![badge-matrix][]][link-matrix] [![badge-opencollective][]][link-opencollective]

Stream VR games from your PC to your headset via Wi-Fi.  
ALVR uses technologies like [Asynchronous Timewarp](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-timewarp-overview) and [Fixed Foveated Rendering](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-ffr) for a smoother experience.  
All games that work with an Oculus Rift (s) should work with ALVR.  
This is a fork of [ALVR](https://github.com/polygraphene/ALVR).
