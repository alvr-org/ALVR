## Launcher (BETA)

Launcher will allow you to manage old, current and new installations of ALVR streamer and allow to automatically install and upgrade to specific ALVR app version on headset

### Installation

* Download `alvr_launcher_windows.zip` (on Windows) or `alvr_launcher_linux.tar.gz` (on Linux) from the release [download page](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/releases/latest) and extract into a path that contains only ASCII characters (english only) and has edit permissions without administrator or root rights.
* Run `ALVR Launcher.exe` (on Windows) or `alvr_launcher_linux/ALVR Launcher` (on Linux)
* Press `Add version` button
* For default installation keep channel and version as is and press `Install`

### Usage

* Launch ALVR app on your headset. While the headset screen is on, click `Trust` next to the device entry (in the ALVR streamer app on PC, in the `Devices` tab) to start streaming.
* You can change settings on the PC in the `Settings` tab. Most of the settings require to restart SteamVR to be applied. Use the apposite button on the bottom right corner.

For any problem visit the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/wiki/Troubleshooting).

### Windows microphone streaming

To use the microphone you need to install the [VB-CABLE driver](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).
Set "CABLE Output" as the default microphone.
Then you can enable the microphone in the ALVR setting, leave "Virtual microphone input" to Default.

### Flatpak

For Flatpak users, refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/wiki/Installing-ALVR-and-using-SteamVR-on-Linux-through-Flatpak)

## Advanced usage

### Use ALVR together with third-party drivers

By default ALVR disables other SteamVR drivers before starting. Among these drivers there is [Driver4VR](https://www.driver4vr.com/) for full body tracking. ALVR disables these drivers to maximize compatibility with every PC setup. You can disable this behavior by manually registering the ALVR driver. Go to the `installation` tab and click on `Register ALVR driver`. The next time you launch ALVR you will be able to use the other drivers concurrently.

### Launch ALVR together with SteamVR

You can skip the ALVR Dashboard and open ALVR automatically together with SteamVR.

**Note:** You can only do that while SteamVR is not already running. Otherwise driver might be unregistered on shutdown.

Open ALVR, go to the `Installation` tab and click on `Register ALVR driver`.

### Connect headset to PC via a USB Cable
