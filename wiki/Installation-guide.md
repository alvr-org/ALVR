# Installation guide

## Basic installation

PC side:

* Install SteamVR, **launch it once** then close it. This is to make sure it sets the environment correctly for ALVR.
* Go to the latest release [download page](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/releases/latest). In the "Assets" section at the bottom download the ALVR Installer.
* Run the installer. If prompted, allow the execution in the SmartScreen popup. You need to give administrator permissions to install ALVR. For best compatibility do not change the installation folder.
* Once the installation finished, launch ALVR. You are greeted with a setup wizard. Follow the setup to set the firewall rules and presets.

**If you have problems launching ALVR, follow the guide below to use the portable version**

Headset side:

* Install SideQuest on your PC and enable developer mode on the headset. You can follow [this guide](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto).
* Connect your headset to Sidequest. If you have an Oculus Quest 1/2 download the ALVR app [here](https://sidequestvr.com/app/9), if you have an Oculus Go download it [here](https://sidequestvr.com/app/2658)

### Usage

* Launch ALVR on your headset. While the headset screen is on, click `Trust` next to the client entry (on the PC) to start streaming.
* You can change settings on the PC in the `Settings` tab. Most of the settings require to restart SteamVR to be applied. Use the apposite button on the bottom right corner.

For any problem visit the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Advanced installation

### Portable version

There is also a portable version for the PC that requires more manual steps to make it work.

* Install SteamVR and launch it once.
* Download `alvr_streamer_windows.zip` from the latest release [download page](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/releases/latest).
* Unzip into a path that contains only ASCII characters and has edit permissions without administrator rights.

### Nightly

If you want to get new features early or you want to help with testing you can install a nightly version.

Download the latest nightly streamer [here](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR-nightly/releases/latest). Download the latest nightly client from Sidequest ([download](https://sidequestvr.com/app/2281)).

Since nightly releases can be unstable, always use matching versions for PC and headset. They are updated once a day.

### Windows microphone streaming

To use the microphone you need to install the [VB-CABLE driver](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/). Set "CABLE Output" as the default microphone. Then you can enable the microphone in the ALVR setting, leave "Virtual microphone input" to Default.

### Use ALVR together with third-party drivers

By default ALVR disables other SteamVR drivers before starting. Among these drivers there is [Driver4VR](https://www.driver4vr.com/) for full body tracking. ALVR disables these drivers to maximize compatibility with every PC setup. You can disable this behavior by manually registering the ALVR driver. Go to the `installation` tab and click on `Register ALVR driver`. The next time you launch ALVR you will be able to use the other drivers concurrently.

### Launch ALVR together with SteamVR

You can skip the ALVR Dashboard and open ALVR automatically together with SteamVR. Open ALVR, go to the `Installation` tab and click on `Register ALVR driver`.

### Connect headset and PC via a USB Cable

Check out the guide [here](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/wiki/Using-ALVR-through-a-USB-connection).

## Linux

### Arch Linux (AUR)

* Install `rustup` and a rust toolchain, if you don't have it: <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rust#Arch_Linux_package>.
* Install [alvr](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/alvr)<sup>AUR</sup> (recommended), or [alvr-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/alvr-git)<sup>AUR</sup>
* Install SteamVR, **launch it once** then close it.
* Run `alvr_dashboard` or ALVR from your DE's application launcher.

### Semi-Automatic Distrobox installation and guidance

Notes:

* This should be used in case you can't install or have issues with ALVR on your system. Do note that on Nvidia it uses host drivers and cuda nvenc, so if you're on older distribution like Debian and having older driver and cuda version, it will not work properly either way.

* Guide also contains fixes, tweaks, additional software like desktop overlay to help you run with steamvr better and workaround it's issues.

Installation:

1. Download zip from https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR-Distrobox-Linux-Guide, unpack it somewhere in your home directory (steam doesn't like long paths) or `git clone https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR-Distrobox-Linux-Guide.git`.
   
   If you want to use nightly (potentially unstable, but fresh) builds, set `IS_NIGHTLY=0` variable in `env.sh` to `IS_NIGHTLY=1`.

2. `cd ALVR-Distrobox-Linux-Guide`

3. Carefully follow the [guide](ALVR-in-distrobox.md).

4. Any issues related to this installer/various tweaks/bugs should be reported as issue [here](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR-Distrobox-Linux-Guide/issues)
